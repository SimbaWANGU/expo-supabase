# Sera

Sera is a note taking app, built for fun with the intention of writing down random thought I have while on holidays.

## Usage

To start the app, you can download an android version here [Android](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/e4LUppSMqf7aeeefkK2XnE.apk). 

This will attempt to download the android apk. The android OS will throw you a couple of warnings since it's not a registered app. Heck, it'not even finished anyway.

## Tech Stack

I love this part, let me geek off:

- Expo: A framework for building cross-platform apps with React Native.
- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps.
- TypeScript: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript, providing improved code quality and editor support.
- Expo Router: to manage the routing mechanism.
- Supabase - An open source alternative to firebase, setup with PostgreSQL.
- Sentry- To track crashes and errors.
